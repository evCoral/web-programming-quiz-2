    <body>My name is Earl Vincent Coral and i was born in Pagadian city here in Mindanao at March 29,1999. 
        My parents name is Virginia and erwin, and the way they thought of my name was creating a new way of saying their name
        Erwin would be Earl, and Virginia is Vincent thus creating my name Earl Vincent.

        <p></p>There are plenty of things i like and i dont like, i will start with i dont like. I am not a fan of Vegetables, especially
        lettuce and cabagges because of their bland and leafy taste. If there are vegetables i eat, its only limited to potatoes, tomato, carrots
        and a few more. The things i like would probably like Meat and tasty food. Those are the type of foods i like.

        <p></p>Moving on to the things i like to do, which is writing stories, or writing in general. I love how my mind writes adventures that
        are not going to be real. Adventures that will stay within the paper i write. I am learning everyday of new profound ways of writing and expanding
        my vocabulary as well. I also like playing Video games, where i dont have a prefered taste in Games, any game is good as long as its Fun and enjoyable.
        But if its a competitive type of game, i would games like MOBA games and maybe sometimes FPS games.

        <p></p>My goals in life, one of my main goal is to create a business where my future family can be stable and a have a good life.
        But for now one of my goals is graduating with a degree in computer science as i always wanted to program or create a program that represents
        a new artificial human. Its a long stretch of a goal but with determination i am sure that i can do it.
